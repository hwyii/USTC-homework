# USTC-homework
 Homework (code) and Course materials in USTC from 2020 to 2024, including 
 
1. **Introduction to Machine Learning** 2022 Fall
Including homework(references), PPT in class and the code for 5 labs, which is the most important part in this class. The labs were all wrote in Python, and we were not allowed to use libraries except for numpy and pandas. The labs are as follows:
- Logistic Regression (LR)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- XGBoost
- Clustering by fast search and find of density peaks
The task is to implement the paper by ourselves.
- Comprehensive Experiment
The task is to fully complete machine learning engineering, including feature engineering, model selection, model tuning.
Attention: the dataset is invalid.
2. **Deep Learning Basics** 2023 Spring
Training Resnet18 and complete word level language. It is very basic.
3. **Multivariate Analysis A** 2023 Fall
Thanks to Professor Yang, Yaning, and one can refer to [Link](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~ynyang/vector/).
4. **Time Series Analysis A** 2022 Fall
5. **Regression Analysis** 2022 Fall
Some materials for R and Python guidance. It is possible helpful for greenhand.
6. **Applied Statistical Software** 2022 Spring
7. **Data thinking** 2021 Fall
Develop a Python GUI showing the weather in Hefei. It demonstrates the temperature, humidity and wind scale both in 24h and in 14 days.

Hope it can help you!
